# Tensorboard

## Overview
Tensorboard provides a range of tools for visualizing the learning
process of a neural network. It takes a history object, generated during the
training of network as input and uses it to generate multiple graphs. The board
is especially useful for vizualizing a model's accuracy and loss. 

## Setup
Tensorboard gets initialized by defining a directory, which is going to used to
store log files, generated by the learning process. After having defined the log
directory, a Tensorflow callback function needs to be defined, that takes the
log directory at one of its inputs. The complete function is shown below:

```
log_dir = f'logs/fit/{datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M")}'
tensorboard = tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(log_dir, histogram_freq=1)
```
After having defined the callback function, the model fit function recieves the
the function as one of the callback function.
```
model.fit(train_gen,
          epochs=10,
          steps_per_epoch=200,
          validation_data=val_gen,
          verbose=1,
          callbacks=[tensorboard])
```
Finally, Tensorboard gets started by using the command, defined below:

```
tensorboard --logdir logs/fit
```

What is this blog about?

I like to focus on three things:

* Provide in-depth Angular tutorials

* Guides for using machine learning for financial forcasting

* Articles about getting stuff done
